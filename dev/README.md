# YOWL

## Starting the project

To get started with Yowl, you're provided with two shell scripts that you can run to setup everything.

To do this, clone this repository like so:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:EpitechDigitalPromo2026/D-YOW-100-BDX_group-1.git
cd D-YOW-100-BDX_group-1/
```

Then you can start the two scripts like so :

```bash
./api.sh
```

```bash
./site.sh
```

If this gives you a permission denied error, you can fix it like this :

```bash
chmod +x api.sh
chmod +x site.sh
```

And voila, just like this you've got the project up and running. Further configuration can be done in the `dev/api/config.json` and `dev/yowl/config.json` file.
